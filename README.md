# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hello, my name is Dulce. I'm currently 21, an INFJ, and pursuing my Bachelor's of Science degree in Cybersecurity at SPC. I do not know anything about GitHub but my main goal is to utilize it and add projects over to my LinkedIn profile. I hope to be a cybersecurity analyst in the future. Go Titans!
